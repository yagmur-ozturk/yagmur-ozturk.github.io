#### Title 
_Comparative Morphosemantics of French and Turkish: from Theoretical Description to a Semantic Decomposition Tool_

#### Abstract
Despite the typological differences between French and Turkish, we make the assumption that comparison between these two languages can be made in terms of meaning and meaning construction processes. Thus, our theoretical objectives are as follows: to develop "an inventory of meanings", supported by non-lexical morphemes (autonomous and non-autonomous) in each of these languages ; compare these inventories through processes of deconstruction and reconstruction of meanings ; and establish correspondences and divergences between these inventories. The applicative objective is to create a tool used in computer-assisted language learning by both French speakers.
